# Coding Problems

# Instructions:
1. Code in any language.
2. Try to reduce time complexity using better algorithm or an efficient data structure.
3. Attempt all three questions.

# Questions
1. The “King Number” is a prime number that is the factor of the most numbers in a given list. Can you find the “King Number”  in each list? For example, for the list {2, 3, 5, 6, 9}, the answer is 3, since it's a factor of 3, 6, and 9, while 2 is only a factor of 2 and 6. 

2. Given a positive integer, write a program to print all possible sum combinations using positive integers.
E.g., With 5 as the input, the program should print.  
1+1+1+1+1  
1+1+1+2  
1+1+3  
1+2+2  
1+4   
2+3   
5

3. On election day, a voting machine writes data in the form (voter_id, candidate_id). Write a program that takes data as array of (voter_id, candidate_id) and returns the top 3 candidates at any given time. If you find a voter voting more than once, report this as fraud and dont count this voter's vote and print these voters id.   
Example: For data: [(1,2), (2,3),(3,2), (1,3), (4,3), (5,3),(6,2), (7,3), (8,2), (9,3),(10,1), (11,4), (12,4)] , output should be,   
Top Three candidates: 3, 2, 4    
Fraud candiates: 1
